Demonstrating Requirements
-----------------------------------
Main scene file: MainMenu


Click through main menu, see hover/see effects. Then click the credits button to display the credits sequence. The game will automatically return to the main menu when the credits scroll is done. Finally, press the start button to open the alpha. 


Design Decisions
-----------------------------------
We chose a toonish futuristic style for the game, so the buttons follow this theme with their shape and changes on interaction. The camera has post-processing effects such as bloom to fit the theme as well.
